## Project Description

This is the final Capstone project I completed in the Hyperion Dev Data Science Bootcamp. It contains analysis of a dataset about arrests for violent crime in the 50 states of the USA in 1973. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/halimedogan/usarrests.

The analysis consists of initial exploration and visualisation of the data. Principal Components Analysis is then applied to the data and two principal components were generated. This PCA data was then clustered using both agglomerative and K-Means clustering and interpretations were made about the patterns of arrests for violent crime across US states.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
This project was created in Python version 3.10.6. 

Python packages: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy. 

This project should be opened in a software which can open Jupyter Notebooks. It was created using Visual Studio Code.

### Installation
This project should be installed in the same folder as the csv document containing US Arrest data. The csv document should be named "USArrests.csv".

### Running the program
Running the program will generate output within the ipynb document. Some example screenshots can be seen below.
